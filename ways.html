                There are many ways to play Darts, the most common are the game of x301 and x501. These work the same way, just starting at different numbers, in these games you work down from 501 or 301, where every three darts thrown the score is totalled and taken
                away from the main total. You need to make it down to double territory then, with the highest double being the bullsye with 50 points, to finish you must land on exactly 0 with your final dart being a double. Another way to play would be around the world,
                in which you have to throw darts in ascending order hitting each number before moving on to the next 1 through to 20 and then finish on the bullsye. And finally a fun one to play with friends is killer, in which you must throw a dart with your left hand to
                determine your number, then you must hit your number 3 times to become a killer (which will mean you have three lives) doubles and triples are active and score accordingly, from then you must hit other peoples numbers where their lives are kept track of aswell
                as your own and you must remove all of their lives whilst keeping your own. It should be noted if you drop below the three lives you must again hit your number to make it to three again before you can throw at other peoples numbers.
